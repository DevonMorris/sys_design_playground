# REST

## Description
a REST API is an api confirming to REST architectural constraints. These c
constrains are
* Client-Server Architecture
* Statelessness
* Cacheability
* Layered System (routing agnostic)
* Code on demand (send code back to client to run, e.g. js)
* Uniform interface

## What Problem(s) Does it Solve
In 1990s web protocols were fragmented and eventually converged on URI, HTTP &
HTML. REST emerged as an architectural style that leveraged these technologies
to produce the following results
* Loose coupling between client and server
* scalability for large number of interactions among components
* Simplicity from uniform interface
* Portability of code (code and data are the same)
